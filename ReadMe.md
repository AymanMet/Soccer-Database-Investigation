# Investigate a Datset: European Soccer Database

* This soccer database comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). It contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016.
* The database is stored in a SQLite database. You can access database files using software like [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
* After exploring the data, we are going to assess and clean the data so that we can answer these research questions:

1. #### What player attributes is linked with the high potential & overall rating?
2. #### What teams attributes lead to most goals scoring & most defeated teams?
